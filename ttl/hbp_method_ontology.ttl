After 50 min incubation at 42 degree C, the cDNA was frozen and stored at -20 degree C before further processing. Multiplex PCR was carried out as described in Toledo-Rodriguez et al. 2004. Briefly the first amplification round consisted of 10 min hot start at 95 degree C followed by 25 cycles (94 degree C for 40 s, 56 degree C for 40 s and 72 degree C for 1 min). A second round of PCR consisted of 40 cycles (94 degree C for 40 s, 56 degree C for 40 s and 72 degree C for 1 min) was performed. The products of the second PCR were analysed in 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Genes were considered expressed if the PCR amplification produced a single band of the correct molecular weight (notice that Kv3.4 and Kv4.3 have two splice variants). The genes co-amplified in each multiplex PCR reaction were: Pool I (CB, PV, CR, NPY, VIP, SOM, CCK and GAPDH); Pool II (SP, ChAT, POMC, pENK, Dyn, nNOS, CRH, CGRP and Caa1E); (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.6, Kv2.1, Kv2.2, Kv3.1, Kv3.2, Kv4.2, Kvb1, Kvb2, HCN1, HCN2, Gad65 and Gad67); Pool IV (Kv1.4, Kv3.3, Kv3.4, Kv4.3, KChIP1, KChIP2, KChIP3, HCN3, HCN4, Caa1A, Caa1B, Caa1G, Caa1H, Caa1I, Cab1, Cab3, Cab4, SK1, SK2 and SK3).

                 nsu:definition "The 3D reconstruction of the histological sections was two-fold: first, the artifacts were corrected in the original sections; second, the corrected sections were aligned using section-to-section registration. The multi-scale registration is performed using minctracc, calibrated and optimized for 2D histological sections. For each section, its three immediate previous and post neighboring sections were registered and intensity-normalized to the middle section. These normalized registered sections were averaged and outlier voxels were detected based on the local variance of the averaged intensities. A crucial issue for the detection of outliers was not to consider the variance on a pixel-by-pixel basis (which is too sensitive to biological variations of the tissue and SNR), but to consider the total variance in a small neighborhood of n x n blocks (n=25 yields a block of 0.25mm x 0.25mm). Outliers were removed on a block-by-block basis by replacing the n x n block by the corrected average (median) of the neighboring sections, excluding outliers (outliers can be present in the reference section as well as in the neighboring sections). This process was repeated twice, using the repaired sections in the first iteration to improve the non-linear alignment and intensity normalization in the second iteration. The final repaired section has been restored with high fidelity. This artifact correction procedure consumed 6 to 8 CPU hours per section. The alignment of the repaired sections was accomplished in two steps. In the first step, the histological sections were registered to the corresponding sections of the MRI aligned to the blockface volume. This corrects for the vertical compression of the tissues in the slicing direction and aligns each section to its average position based on the MRI reference. In the second step, a multi-scale multi-resolution iterative algorithm is deployed to correct for the local displacement, distortion and stretch of sections relative to the MRI reference. In essence, the position and shape of a section are corrected to be at the mid-position of its immediate previous and next section neighbors. Finally, intensity imbalances due to staining were corrected, to first-order, within each aligned section, then globally throughout the brain by histogram equilibration. Some residual intensity imbalances, however, persist in sections with poor gray-white matter contrast."@en ;

Individual brain volumes were co-registered to MNI space at 400 micrometers to obtain a groupwise quantitative T1 average atlas. The BigBrain volume was then processed with N3 to correct for remaining inhomogeneities in staining intensity after averaging. Non-brain regions close to brain tissue were labeled and assigned an arbitrary intensity value so as to be comparable with CSF regions in the stereotaxic T1 atlas.

The specimen was imaged in a custom 30 mm diameter × 50 mm long solenoid RF coil fabricated from a continuous sheet of high-frequency microwave substrate (Roger Corp, Rogers, CT, USA). T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) anatomic images were acquired using a 3D sequence (TR = 50 ms, TE = 8.3 ms, NEX = 2, α = 60°). The acquisition matrix was 1024 × 512 × 512 over a 40 × 20 × 20 mm field of view (FOV). The Nyquist isotropic spatial resolution was 39 μm. Diffusion tensor datasets were acquired using a spin-echo pulse sequence (TR = 100 ms, TE = 16.2 ms, NEX = 1). Diffusion preparation was accomplished using a modified Stejskal–Tanner diffusion-encoding scheme with a pair of unipolar, half-sine diffusion gradient waveforms (width δ = 4 ms, separation Δ = 8.5 ms, gradient amplitude = 450 mT/m). One b0 image and six high b-value images (b = 1500 s/mm2) were acquired with diffusion sensitization along each of six non-colinear diffusion gradient vectors: [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, − 1, 0], [0, 1, − 1], and [− 1, 0, 1].

All images were derived from fully sampled k-space data with no zero-filling. All images had a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of 30 or greater. The long TR relative to T1 and the long TE relative to T2 give the b0 image strong T2-weighting. We therefore refer to the b0 image as T2-weighted below. The SNR for the average isotropic DWI was ~ 120, and the SNR for the individual DWIs was ~ 62. The SNR for the T2*-weighted gradient echo was estimated ~ 50.

The MRI data were viewed in ITK-SNAP using the default 16-bit grayscale color map (black to white), where dark areas in the image correspond to low signal intensity and bright areas correspond to high signal intensity. Neuroanatomical boundaries were delineated on basis of image contrast observed in T2-weighted, T2*-weighted, and diffusion weighted images, including RGB maps of principal eigenvector orientation with fractional anisotropy represented by image intensity (DTI maps). Two standard rat brain atlases were used as initial anatomical reference ( Paxinos and Watson, 2007 and Swanson, 2004). Additional anatomical criteria (see the Results section) were employed to close anatomical boundaries when these were not unequivocally visible in the MRI or DTI images. The neuroanatomical nomenclature was adopted from the Paxinos and Watson (2007) atlas of the rat brain. The left and right hemispheres of the brain were delineated individually. At one location, a small unilateral magnetic field interference artifact prevented delineation (see also Neuroanatomical delineations in the Results section). The boundary in question was then manually transferred from the other side, taking into consideration a slight left–right tilt of the coronal plane, making structures on the right side of the brain appear 1–2 slices (39–78 μm) towards anterior compared to the left side. Semi-automatic segmentation was performed in adequate high-contrast regions using the intensity region based SNaP algorithm implemented in ITK-SNAP, producing a segmentation core for a limited number of structures. Manual segmentation steps were taken iteratively for all delineated regions, performed by a single investigator based on combined observations in the different dMRI maps in coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. Our delineation of boundaries was aided by inspection of histological maps provided in the reference atlases (Paxinos and Watson, 2007 and Swanson, 2004), as well as by series of histological sections from brains of other Sprague Dawley specimens, cut in coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes, and stained for myelin (Woelche, 1942) and cytoarchitecture (material from Leergaard et al., 2010; S. Lillehaug, J.G. Bjaalie, and T.B. Leergaard, unpublished results). Thus, changes in T2 and T2* signal intensity were compared to changes in cell densities observed in thionine stained sections from corresponding regions, while changes in DTI color maps were interpreted based on observation of corresponding myelin stained fiber orientations. Structures from the hippocampal and parahippocampal region, delineated in the same template, were taken from a parallel study (L.J. Kjonigsen, T.B. Leergaard, M.P. Witter, and J.G. Bjaalie, in preparation)."@en ;

Mice are transferred from the vivarium to the histology core with efforts to minimize stress during the transfer. If mouse body weight falls outside of the normal range (18.8 to 26.4g), the brain is not used in the ABA ISH process. Mice are anesthetized with 0.5% isoflurane. Brains are rapidly dissected and frozen in OCT mounting medium in a grid-lined freezing chamber designed to allow for standardized placement of the brain within the block in order to minimize variation in sectioning plane. Brains are frozen at -80 degree C prior to sectioning. The fresh frozen brains are sectioned at 25 micrometers on Leica 3050 S cryostats. This thickness is optimal for minimizing sectioning artifacts such as stretching and folding during cutting and adequate for probe penetration into the section during the ISH procedure. Each OCT block containing a fresh frozen brain is trimmed until reaching the plane of Figure 99 of the Atlas of the Mouse Brain for coronal sections, and to approximately Figure 128 for sagittal sections (The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, Paxinos and Franklin, Second Edition, 2001). Starting at this plane of section, a fixed number of sections spanning the rest of the brain are collected. One sagittal-sectioned brain will generate 8 series of 5 slides (Figure 8), each containing four 25 microm thick sections. One coronal-sectioned brain will generate 8 series of 15 slides (Figure 9). Slides are grouped into series (8 series per brain, with 4 sections per slide) that contain sections 200 micrometer apart, allowing for uniform sampling every 200 microm across the entire brain for each gene. All but the smallest neuro-anatomical structures should be represented in at least one section at this sampling density. A given series is either hybridized to a single gene or used for Nissl staining for anatomical reference. After allowing the sections to air dry on the slides for a minimum of 30 minutes, the tissue is fixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 minutes and rinsed for 3 minutes in 1x PBS. Next, the tissue is equilibrated briefly in 0.1 M triethanolamine and acetylated for 10 minutes in 0.1 M triethanolamine with 0.25% acetic anhydride. Acetylation is necessary to reduce non-specific probe binding to the tissue sections. Several chemical functional groups in proteins, such as amine and carboxylate groups, are believed to induce nonspecific probe binding, consequently leading to higher background levels and lower signal/noise ratios. Acetylation of positively charged amine groups by treating tissue sections with acetic anhydride reduces nonspecific binding of negatively charged nucleic acid probes. Immediately following acetylation, the tissue is dehydrated through a graded series containing 50%, 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol. Following the dehydration process, each slide is analyzed microscopically to ensure section quality. Slides that pass QC are stored at room temperature in Parafilm-sealed slide boxes. Nissl staining is a histological procedure that labels Nissl bodies, the ribosomal RNA associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. A series of Nissl slides serve as a cytoarchitectural reference to help identify specific cell populations detected on proximate series of slides processed by ISH. After a brain is sectioned, series 4 and 8 are baked at 37 degree C for 1-5 days, and stored in desiccated containers until staining. Sections are defatted with xylene or the xylene substitute Formula 83, and hydrated through a graded series containing 100%, 95%, 70%, and 50% ethanol. After incubation in water, the sections are stained in 0.25% thionin, which stains the Nissl bodies purple-blue. Next, the sections are differentiated and dehydrated in water and a graded series containing 50%, 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol. Finally, the slides are incubated in xylene or Formula 83, and coverslipped with the mounting agent DPX. After drying, the slides are analyzed microscopically to ensure staining quality. Slides that have passed QC are stored at room temperature in slide boxes before being cleaned and scanned."@en ;

These ICS stations operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week with minimal operator oversight other than loading slides twice per day. The scanning platform hardware and software components are outlined below. The 10 ICS units are placed on four TMC air tables to isolate the microscopes from external sources of vibration that would affect image quality. Microscope and camera function is actuated by Image Pro 5.1 with the Scope Pro/Stage Pro 5.0 Plug-In. The scanning process is controlled by the ScopeController, a custom application developed by the ABA project team .The microscope is configured for Koehler illumination and lamp intensity is adjusted to create the brightest possible field of illumination without saturating more than 1% of image pixels on a microscope slide and coverslip. The image is white balanced and a background correction image for the 10x objective is collected using ImagePro camera controls. A background correction image is also collected for the 1.25x objective."@en ;

(1) Fixation and impregnation: After the animal was anesthetized with 1% sodium pentobarbital, the whole brain was removed and tied with a thread at the medulla oblongata. The brain was then suspended in fresh Golgi-Cox solution for fixation and impregnation, after which it was placed in a brown bottle and maintained in the dark at 20–25 degree C. The brains in all of the following procedures were kept suspended before being embedded. The Cox solution was replaced the next day and then every 30 days. The impregnation was maintained for at least 180 days. The Golgi-Cox solution consisted of two solutions that were mixed uniformly and filtrated: solution A, which contained 1 g mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and 1g potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) dissolved in 64 g of distilled water; and solution B, which contained 0.8 g potassium chromate (K2CrO4) dissolved in 16 g distilled water. (2) Darkening: The brain was immersed in a solution of 1% lithium hydroxide (LiOH), placed in a brown bottle for 24 h and rinsed under running water for another 24 h. For darkening and the subsequent dehydration and infiltration steps, the solution was constantly kept on a rotary shaker (rotating diameter: 20 mm; speed: 1 r/s). (3) Dehydration: The rinsed brain was sequentially immersed in 50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, 100% alcohol, 100% alcohol–acetone (1:1), and 100% acetone, each for 2 h, and finally, was immersed in another 100% acetone solution for 10 h. (4) Infiltration and embedding: After dehydration, the brain was infiltrated in 50%, 75%, 100% (2×) Spurr resin, each for 8 h. The brain was then completely immersed in a silicone mould filled with 100% Spurr resin. The mould was then maintained in an oven at 60 degree C for 36 h for polymerization. After returning to room temperature, the embedded brain was kept in a desiccator before the experiments. All the Spurr reagents (SPI, USA) were freshly prepared. The 100% Spurr resin contained 10 g vinylcyclohexene dioxide (ERL-4221), 7.6 g diglycidyl ether of polypropylene glycol (DER-736), 26 g nonenyl succinic anhydride (NSA), and 0.2 g dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE).
